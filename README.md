=============

Contains my research interests and publications.

Uses Twitter's invaluable [Bootstrap framework][1] and some [jQuery magic][2].

Recently has been updated to make use of Christian Robertson's awesome font
[Roboto Condensed][3].  I have also added a lot of color -- enjoy it while it
remains available;  I'm not fully convinced yet ;)
